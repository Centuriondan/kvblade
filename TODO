Here is a list of things that need to be addressed.

* Export a block device on multiple interfaces, with
the same major/minor and with different major/minor.

This probably works, but needs to be tested.

* Root the kvblade sysfs tree in /sys/modules/kvblade.

This is just for cleanliness.  The solution must not
break the simplicity with which the driver currently
uses attributes.  I'd like to see the fix be as simple
as having kobj.parent point to the right place.

* Support jumbo frames.

Much of the aoe support code is there, but the interface
to the block device needs to be worked out.  I highly
expect a jumbo frame test to provide "interesting" results.

* Solve speed problems when using real block devices.

Access to real block devices is slow.  Throughput to
loopback devices on a file in a filesystem is 
decent, leading me to believe there's some limitation
that caching would solve.  It could be that we're effectively
only processing one request at a time.  On a real
block device that's 1K reads/writes (sans jumbo) that
must go to disk before responding.  Or, it could simply
be that 1K I/O even with 16 outstanding is slow.
